Differences between NumPy and Python arrays

1. NumPy arrays have fixed size at creation, unlike Python lists which can grow 
dynamically. Changing the size of "ndarray" from NumPy will create a new array 
and delete the original. 

2. Elements in NumPy array are required to be of the same data type, thus is the 
same size in memory. Exception: Arrays (both Python and NumPy) of objects can be created, 
thus allowing arrays of different sized elements 

3. NumPy arrays facilitate advanced math and other types of operations on large numbers of data. 

4. Growing number of Python-based packages require input and produce outputs of NumPy arrays
